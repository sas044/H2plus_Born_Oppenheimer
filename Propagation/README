   PROPAGATION OF H2+
========================

by Sigurd Askeland (sigurd.askeland@gmail.com)

This part of the software package is supposed to propagate the wavefunction,
using the Hamiltonian matrix created by the programs in the parent directory.

Note
====
The programs are not as well documented as those in the parent directory.
This propagator uses the Python ode solver. It has behaved erratically for me,
and cannot handle large problems, i.e. > 10 electronic states. For larger
problems, and more stable propagation, see ../Fortran_propagation/.

Main program
============
propagate.py : main program for Born Oppenheimer propagation of H2+.

electronic_propagation :  main program for FNA propagation of H2+.


Supporting programs
===================
ode_support.py : program for doing the matrix vector multiplication.
ode_support_parallel.py : program for doing the matrix vector multiplication in
    ... you guessed it, PARALLEL!
make_fc_init.py : create an initial state from grid. Needs some supporting data you will
    have to supply yourself. Not necessary if you start in an eigenstate.
