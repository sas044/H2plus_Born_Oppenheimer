   FORTRAN PROPAGATION OF H2+
================================

by Sigurd Askeland (sigurd.askeland@gmail.com)

This part of the software package contains propagation tools written in Fortran,
for efficiency. That includes an ode solver (not made by me), and a matrix
vector multiplication scheme. Parallelized in electronic states.

NOTE
====
The python scripts in this directory may be lacking good documentation.
The Makefile may have to be adjusted significantly for your computer. 
Make sure HDF5 and MPI packages are installed.

Main program
============
main.f90 : handles the propagation. 

propagate.py : python script for starting a propagation job on my local
    supercomputer. May give you the idea.

truncated_propagation.py : python script for starting a propagation job on my local
    supercomputer. Lets you use a subset of the electronic states in your
    basis/matrix made by the programs in the parent directory.

Makefile : writing "make" in the terminal should create an executible file based
    on the fortran code. Be prepared to make changes, as it is made to work on
    my local supercomputer.

Supporting programs
===================
ode.f90 : the ode solver. Not made by me. Credits in the file.
propagator.f90 : fortran module for the matrix-vector product, and more.
    Parallelized, HDF5-compatible, pretty fast.
basis_truncation.py : program for truncating the basis and matrix you made
    using the programs in the parent directory.
