   ANALYSIS OF H2+ WAVEFUNCTION
==================================

by Sigurd Askeland (sigurd.askeland@gmail.com)

These programs take care of the analysis of wavefunctions created by the rest 
of this software package.

NOTE
====
The choice of basis functions in the electronic system leads to energy curves in
the continuum that DOES NOT behave as 1/R. This makes the analysis of the
continuum a somewhat risky business. I recommend using the method
energy_spectrum_alternative() in analysis.py for energy spectra, and you should
stick to the close continuum. Use caution. If you solve this problem, please
share. 

Main program
============
analysis.py : contains an analysis class with a pletora of nice methods. Energy
    spectra, probability densities, animations, state populations, etc.

Supporting programs
===================
make_animation.py : creates frames for the animation, with all methods called
    from analysis.py. 
mencoder.sh : shell script for making an avi from the frames.

Example
=======
>>> from numpy import *
>>> from pylab import *
>>> import tables; execfile("analysis.py")

>>> A = Analysis("../Propagation/output/m_0_q_6_xmin_0_50_xmax_18_50_size_464_order_5_trunc_q2_full")
>>> A.retrieve_result("amplitude_0.01000_omega_0.770_cycles_14_extra_time_0.66.npy")

>>> x,y = A.probability_density(A.psi_final, [61])
>>> plot(x,y)
>>> show()
